# Flotte
 
hey there 👋  
we’re **Flotte** — and we are building a tool to make **SSH access for teams** feel simple, more secure and stress-free managable.

---
 
## What we’re about
 
- **short-lived access** – certificates that expire fast, so risk doesn’t pile up  
- **clear permissions** – you know *who* can reach *what*, and why  
- **fits your workflow** – use your normal `ssh`, we handle the boring bits  
- **trust but verify** – human-readable audit trails without the detective work
- **Efficent workflows** – users don't need to lookup credentials, they can just get the job done
 
we’re aiming for that sweet spot: secure by default, still delightful to use and easy to manage.

## Why this exists
 
Teams shouldn’t have to:
- Copy keys around by hand
- Guess who still has access
- Keep ancient private keys on laptops
- Juggle five tools just to log in
 
we think ssh access should be **just-in-time**, **transparent**, and **easy to turn off** when people or servers change.
