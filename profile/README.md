# Flotte
 
hey there 👋  
we’re **Flotte** — a small team building friendly tools that make **SSH access for teams** feel simple, more secure and stress-free managable.

---
 
## what we’re about
 
- **short-lived access** – certificates that expire fast, so risk doesn’t pile up  
- **clear permissions** – you know *who* can reach *what*, and why  
- **fits your workflow** – use your normal `ssh`, we handle the boring bits  
- **trust but verify** – human-readable audit trails without the detective work
 
we’re aiming for that sweet spot: secure by default, still delightful to use and easy to manage.

## why this exists
 
teams shouldn’t have to:
- copy keys around by hand
- guess who still has access
- keep ancient private keys on laptops
- juggle five tools just to log in
 
we think ssh access should be **just-in-time**, **transparent**, and **easy to turn off** when people or servers change.
